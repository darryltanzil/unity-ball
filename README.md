# Get the coins!

A simple Unity application I developed circa 2015- the original source code is now missing, but this is the zip of the compiled version. This is written in C#, and educated me regarding the basics of Unity game development. 

## Installation

- Download the respective MacOS or Windows version of the game
- Extract
- Run the "Get the coins" executable, making sure that the executable is in the same directory as the data folder.
